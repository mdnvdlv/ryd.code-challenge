# Header - problem #

Please have a look at [this codepen](http://codepen.io/truefalse10/pen/oZQydm).

The `<header>` needs to be animated:

* If the user scrolls down, it should slide up until it disappears.
* If the user scrolls up, the header shall reappear sliding down.

It should work on as many devices and browsers as possible.
