Coin Problem
============

Part 1
------

You are given any amount of money in the format X.XX (f.e. `2.34`). 

Implement a function that split this amount in the minimal amount of Euro coins, which represents the given number.

The Euro coins are:

2€, 1€, 50¢, 20¢, 10¢, 5¢, 2¢, 1¢

Example:
Given the amount of 2.34 the result will be `[ 2, 0.2, 0.02, 0.1, 0.02 ]`

Please implement this function.
