Avantgarde problems for applicants
================================

## Guidelines

- Every file and folder is a problem for you to solve.
- All problems are mandatory, but we will take into account to which position you are applying (front end, back end or full stack) when evaluating.
- You can write your solution into the files or create new ones as you see fit.
- Comments are mandatory. Use them to describe your solutions and thought process.
- Test your solutions as you see fit and submit these tests. Use any framework you want.
- Do not change our tests.
- If you think there has been any mistake from our side, correct it and add a comment.
- All tests shall pass (i.e. the ones we provide and yours if you add more).
- Keep all your changes in a new branch and open a merge request to master.
