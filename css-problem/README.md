CSS-Centering
=============

- Center the text and the button in the page.
- Make the green color background take the whole browser page.
- The button has to stay always at the bottom of the page.
- As reference see the png image in this repo.
- Feel free to change the structure of the HTML as you prefer.
- Button and font sizes should dynamically adjust according to the browser window size.
- It's up to you to decide whether to adopt responsive or adaptive layout
